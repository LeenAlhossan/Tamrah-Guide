# Tamrah-Guide
A smart mobile app that helps visitors choose the best type of dates by providing clear information, price calculation, and AI-based recommendations
I built the Tamrah Guide application using the Mocha platform ðŸš€ and was able to transform my idea into a smart, working app in a short time. The app helps visitors of the Qassim Dates Festival discover and explore the most popular Saudi date types through a visually appealing interface that displays images, descriptions, flavors, and comparisons. It also includes a price calculator ðŸ’° and AI-powered smart recommendations based on user preferences ðŸ¤–. The app supports both Arabic and English and delivers a smooth, practical, and engaging user experience.
